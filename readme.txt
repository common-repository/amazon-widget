Amazon widget will take your AWS keys and a Search Term and display a single product with image in your sidebar.  It's a great way to add affilate marketing on your site using Amazon over the traditional and much less useful adsense.  You can see examples of this plugin on <a href="http://allsouthpark.info">All South Park</a>
